<p>Hepatitis, cirrhosis, fatty liver, liver abscess (collection of pus), liver tumors and so on. Wondering what these are?They’re nothing but diseases of the liver which start with minor symptoms of liver problems and go on to reach chronic levels. The conditions and symptoms of which vary from person to person.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-15971 aligncenter" src="https://www.thefitindian.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/liver-disease-guide-banner.jpg" alt="liver-disease-guide-banner" width="600" height="300" srcset="https://www.thefitindian.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/liver-disease-guide-banner.jpg 600w, https://www.thefitindian.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/liver-disease-guide-banner-300x150.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p>The liver, the second largest organ of your body, looks something like a football, and is responsible for a large number of functions. But do you know the most important function of the liver? It’s your very own in-built natural detoxifier! And it does not stop there! There are other functions of the liver, such as storing energy, digesting your food, and so on. The Chinese think that the liver, which derives its name from the word “live”, is the most important organ of the body and we cannot but agree with this potent statement.</p>
<p>An overload of toxins in the liver means bad news for the body! The liver works hard for your body, detoxifies the blood, produces bile to digest fat to break down hormones, and stores some essential vitamins and minerals such as iron. Time to up your green juice intake, especially if you have so long been lazy and just ignored your health (read, thrived on junk food, binged on alcohol and favored the couch instead of the oft-ignored treadmill which has almost turned into a makeshift clothes hanger!)</p>
<p>Hmm, guilty as charged, so is there no way to retrace our steps and get our liver back to functioning optimally? Are you thinking of going for that liver cleanse which you may have stumbled upon while browsing away merrily on the net? Wait! Not so fast! You can go for liver cleanses, but as they say, we often treat our diseases by their symptoms and do not pay attention to the root condition. First, we got to listen to our body and know more about the symptoms of liver problems.</p>

<h4>Liver Problems Symptoms &#8211; Listen to your Body and be Mindful of the Subtle Warnings and Signals</h4>
<p>People who suffer from chronic diseases often repent later, “Why didn’t I listen to my body?” “Why did I just ignore the pain?” And it goes on like this&#8230;you wouldn’t want to do that do you? Have regrets, that is. That is why that seemingly harmless bloating may have a completely different saga to tell only if we cared to pay heed. Take a note of the following symptoms and yes, do not IGNORE the symptoms, come what may!</p>
<ul>
<li>Bloody, Pale, or tar-colored stools and/or dark colored urine.</li>
<li>Nausea with little or no appetite</li>
<li>Fatigue</li>
<li>Liver pain (You will find pain on the upper right-hand side of the abdomen)</li>
<li>A swollen belly or swelling in the leg or ankle area (Usually caused by ascites or cirrhosis)</li>
<li>Yellowish skin or eyes (Signals a damaged liver unable to process bilirubin, this is the remnants of the old red blood cells when they are broken down)</li>
</ul>
<h4>Other Uncommon Liver Problem Symptoms</h4>
<p>Besides the above symptoms, there are some other not-so-common symptoms as well.  These symptoms are usually noticed when the disease is detected in the advanced stages.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-15747 aligncenter" src="http://www.thefitindian.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Liver-Problem-Symptoms.jpg" alt="liver-problem-symptoms" width="600" height="300" srcset="https://www.thefitindian.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Liver-Problem-Symptoms.jpg 600w, https://www.thefitindian.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Liver-Problem-Symptoms-300x150.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<ul>
<li>Foul Body odor or smell</li>
<li>Sudden development of new type of allergies</li>
<li>Itchy skin</li>
<li>Development of small spider-like capillaries, visible under the skin, known as spider Angiomas</li>
<li>Gynecomastia &#8211; Enlarged male breasts, it occurs because the liver fails to regulate the male hormones</li>
<li>Erectile dysfunction</li>
<li>Skin blemishes and under eye dark circles</li>
<li>Short-term memory loss or confusion (This usually occurs because there is an accumulation of toxins in the brain)</li>
<li>Vomiting blood- Blood flow through the organ is jeopardized when the liver gets scarred, and this builds up the pressure in the stomach and the esophageal veins. Problems arise when the veins burst and lead to blood vomiting. This is definitely a case of medical emergency.</li>
<li>Sudden bruises on the body without signs of any injury. This occurs because your liver is damaged and prevents the production of proteins required for blood clotting, and this increases the chances of bruising or bleeding</li>
</ul>
<p>Elimination is the first stage of healing, by elimination I mean leaving out foods which cause irreparable damage to your liver and consequently, your health. Food nourishes your body, but we so often use it as a way to torture our body and our liver. The only way to stop it is by making the right lifestyle changes. Before I tell you, eat this and eat that and you will be able to fix your liver, strike these foods immediately from your diet, this will certainly answer the question of how to keep the liver healthy.</p>
<h4>How to improve liver function &#8211; Foods to Exclude</h4>
<p>This may come as a shocker for most of us, some of our favorite foods must be eliminated from our diet. But I strongly believe that moderation is the key; too much of anything is bad. Yes, even that glass of green <a href="http://www.thefitindian.com/top-15-fruits-vegetables-ideal-for-juicing/">juice with the healthiest veggies in the world</a>! Take a look at the things which you must start avoiding. These foods will help avoid the three most common liver problems, namely:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-15740 aligncenter" src="http://www.thefitindian.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Foods-to-Exclude.jpg" alt="foods-to-exclude" width="600" height="300" srcset="https://www.thefitindian.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Foods-to-Exclude.jpg 600w, https://www.thefitindian.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Foods-to-Exclude-300x150.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<ul>
<li>Fatty liver</li>
<li>Cirrhosis</li>
<li>Hepatitis A, B, C, D and E (jaundice)</li>
</ul>
<p>Most people think that you only get liver disease or liver problems if you consume alcohol. But that’s not true, anything that is difficult to break down and cannot be utilized for energy ends up in the liver, to get detoxified. Imagine the pressure we put on our poor liver! But are we making the job of detoxification any easier for the liver? Don’t think so, as we overindulge in alcohol, drugs, chemicals, fried foods, processed or refined foods (this includes a great many foods such as white flour, white sugar, pasteurized dairy, white sugar, low-quality meat to name just a few), your liver faces the brunt in almost every way.</p>
<p><strong>Alcohol</strong></p>
<p>Binging on too much of alcohol? That can prove to be costly to your health! Alcohol is not our only vice, we combine it with other vices such as cigarettes, prescription and/or over-the-counter medications, and a diet that your grandmother would certainly disapprove of! (Too much of packaged foods and not having enough whole, nutritious home-cooked food).</p>
<p>If you are suffering from fatty liver disease, your first step would be to kick the bad habits, period! The combination of fatty liver disease and the consumption of alcohol can spell Disaster with a capital D!  If you have fatty liver disease and are a heavy drinker, quitting is the most important thing to do. Even if you are suffering from the non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, you should try and eliminate alcohol from your diet.</p>
<p><strong>High-Carbohydrate Foods</strong></p>
<p>Avoid too much of carb-laden foods such as bread, rice, corn, and grits. Don’t leave them out completely, just consume them in moderation. One way to detox your liver is to stop consuming the so-called “white foodstuff”;they include white bread, white rice and so on. When we over-consume refined carbs or any kind of carbs for that matter, our insulin levels spike tremendously and these constant spikes can finally lead to liver diseases. But yes, you cannot suddenly leave out these foods from your diet, try to reduce the quantity of these foods gradually.</p>

<h3>How to improve liver function &#8211; Try these Home Remedies to Treat Liver Disease</h3>
<p>Now that you have decided that you will show some love to your liver, here are a few important foods that will nourish your body with the right nutrients and keep it healthy for a long time to come. You can reverse the damage caused by an erratic lifestyle with the right nutrition, so if you are asking yourself how to keep your liver healthy;<strong> </strong>then this is the exact way to boost the liver’s function.</p>
<p>Do you know that if you are able to detox the liver in the optimum way, it can also increase your chances of losing weight?Suchis the power of the largest organ of the body, which we, unfortunately, take for granted. Power up your body with these right foods and enable your body to detoxify.</p>
<h4>1. Milk Thistle</h4>
<p>I have come to know about this unusual herb from my naturopathic friend who swears by its efficacy! He says, “You can use it for almost all liver diseases.” That would leave you wondering about the different liver diseases that this wonder herb can treat. The long list includes cirrhosis, viral hepatitis, alcoholic hepatitis, chemical toxicity and so on. You can get milk thistle in any herbal shop or online. Read labels thoroughly and only choose the medicine which is absolutely free of chemicals.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-15749 aligncenter" src="http://www.thefitindian.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Milk-Thistle.jpg" alt="milk-thistle" width="600" height="300" srcset="https://www.thefitindian.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Milk-Thistle.jpg 600w, https://www.thefitindian.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Milk-Thistle-300x150.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p>You can have 900 milligrams of milk thistle twice a day at your mealtimes.</p>
<h4>2. Apple Cider Vinegar</h4>
<p>The next best remedy would surely be apple cider vinegar. This is one of the best remedies to naturally detox your liver. You can have ACV right before your meals, and this will help to metabolize the fat easily.</p>
<p>Just blend one tablespoon of apple cider vinegar into a glass of water. This could be a little too tart to gulp it down. To sweeten it up, blend it up with raw honey. You can drink this concoction thrice a day, but there are many who cannot partake apple cider vinegar. Start it with one tablespoon and then slowly increase the amount for consumption. This is one powerful natural medicine and acts as an antidote to liver problem symptoms.</p>
<h4>3. Dandelion Root Tea</h4>
<p>This root is considered as one of the wonder remedies to cure most of your ailments, and to think, we almost gave up on this root thinking it to be a weed with no benefits whatsoever! So, just sip on this tea for a few days and your liver problems will be sorted in a jiffy! You will just roll your eyes, I know. Even if you do not suffer from any liver ailments, just sipping on this tea for a few days can improve the liver function drastically!</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-15739 aligncenter" src="http://www.thefitindian.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Dandelion-Root-Tea.jpg" alt="dandelion-root-tea" width="600" height="300" srcset="https://www.thefitindian.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Dandelion-Root-Tea.jpg 600w, https://www.thefitindian.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Dandelion-Root-Tea-300x150.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p>I had suddenly spotted this root powder in a food store and was wondering what it could possibly be when my friend asked me to make a tea out of it and sip on it at least twice a day to get real benefits. Also, I tried boiling a few roots in a glass of water and was quite surprised by the results.  Try it to know for yourself what good can it do to your liver!</p>
<h4>4. Amla or Indian Gooseberry</h4>
<p>I am all for having a little bit of amla pickle with my rice and dal. The fact that it is rich in vitamin C makes it a potent medicine. Amla is a very liver-friendly fruit. You can consume at least 3-4 raw amlas for maximum benefits. I also have it grated and have it with a pinch of rock salt, the tang makes me go all wonky-eyed and my lips get all pursed, I still love it and it keeps my liver in optimal condition. Think of innovative ways to add amla to your diet. Share a few of your ideas too, would love to hear some.</p>
<h4>5. Turmeric</h4>
<p>Turmeric is great for your liver health, period. It not only contains antioxidants galore, but has antiseptic properties too. The yellow wonder spice can prevent the thriving of viruses which can lead to hepatitis B and C. Indian cooking does allow us to add ample amount of turmeric to our diets. You can add turmeric to your dals, sabzis and even to your milk. Just a pinch of this golden elixir can do wonders for your health, besides making you sleep like a baby. Is there no end to the benefits of this wonder spice? Apparently not!</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-15587 aligncenter" src="http://www.thefitindian.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Turmeric.jpg" alt="turmeric" width="600" height="300" srcset="https://www.thefitindian.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Turmeric.jpg 600w, https://www.thefitindian.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Turmeric-300x150.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<h4>6. Papaya</h4>
<p>Papaya is another food which can keep your liver functioning at optimal levels. It is especially good for treating liver diseases such as liver cirrhosis. One way to help your liver flush out toxins is just adding two teaspoonful of papaya juice and combiningit with just half a teaspoonful of lemon juice. You can consume it every day without side-effects.</p>
<h4>7. Spinach and Carrot juices</h4>
<p>A blend of spinach and carrot juice is a great remedy for liver cirrhosis. You can combine equal parts of both these juices to make a potent drink to reduce signs and symptoms of liver infection and other liver problems. You can consume this drink every single day to get great results. This is one of the winter juices which I love consuming. I just add a bit of rock salt and pepper powder to make it more appetizing. Sip it early in the morning and you will feel healthy from within; the glow on your face is something else!</p>
<h4>8. Licorice</h4>

<h4>13. Avocado</h4>
<p>This fruit is suddenly the hot contender for the top slot of the most popular healthy foods of all time,upstaging the likes of apples and cruciferous veggies. But the reason avocado is finding its way to our toasts, smoothies and even ice-creams (wait a minute, ice-creams too?) is that this deceptive looking fruit, hideous as it looks, contains so many nutrients.There you go, I have incited the ire of all avocado lovers around the world!</p>
<p>Don’t worry, I love it too, and the smooth texture it lends to my food. Let’s face it, avocado makes healthy eating look chic. Most doctors tout glutathione as the “The Mother of All Antioxidants”. Glutathione is one of the most powerful warriors to slay the enemies, namely waste and toxins, and it helps the liver eliminate these chemicals from the body and protects against cellular damage.</p>
<h4>14. Leafy Vegetables</h4>
<p>Can you ever leave out green veggies from a list of healthy foods? Nope, never! And if it is bitter, you will know it is better! You may not like too many bitter thingsenter your system(you know, bitter words, bitter people, and bitter food!), but you know what? Your liver likes it! I mean, just the bitter food part. Stuff yourself with rapini, dandelion, arugula, mustard greens and also chicory. These leafy greens can initiate cleansing of the liver and neutralize heavy compounds; these heavy metals, by the way, can slow down the liver’s power to detoxify.</p>

<h4>Two Powerful Ways in which Liver Detoxification Process takes Place</h4>
<p>The liver detoxes your body in two phases.</p>
<p>In phase one, the liver takes a toxin and converts it into a less harmful toxin via several processes called oxidation, reduction or hydrolysis. This chemical reaction makes the toxic substances less toxic. This process, however, creates other harmful by-products that should be neutralized with ample antioxidants.</p>
<p>In phase two, the liver becomes even less toxic, owing to a buffer molecule. This toxin is then processed further to become water-soluble and this enables the body to get rid of the extra toxins through urine. Most toxins start the process of elimination in a fat-soluble state, and in this state, the body finds it really hard to excrete.</p>
<p>It goes without saying that both phases of the detoxification process have to work optimally to get to the elimination phase. This detoxification process may face a hurdle when you do not nourish the body with adequate nutrients, one phase does not work in tandem with the other phase and you keep overloading your system with more and more toxins.</p>

<h3>Home remedies for the liver &#8211; Exercise to the Rescue</h3>
<p>Move more and sit less, this is one of the only ways to protect your health, besides of course, eating right. Circulation is the primary way to start the cleansing process. When the body is stagnant, the blood also remains stagnant and hence becomes more prone to diseases. But exercise ensures that your heart pumps more blood. The liver then is able to release more blood to reach the brain, tendons, muscles, and joints. Exercise also enables the nutrients to reach the reproductive and/or digestive organs so it enables smooth menstrual flow and optimal bowel movement.</p>
<p>It is not about what kind of exercises you do; the fact of the matter is that you have to do get up and move your butt! Every day, spare 30 minutes from your busy schedule for your health and count your steps! Always try to notch up at least 10,000 steps in a day, it will mean you have been able to maintain your activity levels, all throughout the day.</p>
